In this paper, we present and discuss our design choices for the application programming interface (API) of the project. In particular, we describe the simple and elegant interface shared by all learning and processing units in the library and then discuss its advantages in terms of composition and reusability. The paper also comments on implementation details specific to the Python ecosystem and analyzes obstacles faced by users and developers of the library.},

	abstract = {We present an open-source Python package to compute information-theoretical quantities for electroencephalographic data. Electroencephalography (EEG) measures the electrical potential generated by the cerebral cortex and the set of spatial patterns projected by the brain’s electrical potential on the scalp surface can be clustered into a set of representative maps called EEG microstates. Microstate time series are obtained by competitively ﬁtting the microstate maps back into the EEG data set, i.e., by substituting the EEG data at a given time with the label of the microstate that has the highest similarity with the actual EEG topography. As microstate sequences consist of non-metric random variables, e.g., the letters A–D, we recently introduced information-theoretical measures to quantify these time series. In wakeful resting state EEG recordings, we found new characteristics of microstate sequences such as periodicities related to EEG frequency bands. The algorithms used are here provided as an open-source package and their use is explained in a tutorial style. The package is self-contained and the programming style is procedural, focusing on code intelligibility and easy portability. Using a sample EEG ﬁle, we demonstrate how to perform EEG microstate segmentation using the modiﬁed K-means approach, and how to compute and visualize the recently introduced information-theoretical tests and quantities. The time-lagged mutual information function is derived as a discrete symbolic alternative to the autocorrelation function for metric time series and conﬁdence intervals are computed from Markov chain surrogate data. The software package provides an open-source extension to the existing implementations of the microstate transform and is speciﬁcally designed to analyze resting state EEG recordings.},

	abstract = {EEG microstate analysis oﬀers a sparse characterisation of the spatio-temporal features of large-scale brain network activity. However, despite the concept of microstates is straight-forward and oﬀers various quantiﬁcations of the EEG signal with a relatively clear neurophysiological interpretation, a few important aspects about the currently applied methods are not readily comprehensible. Here we aim to increase the transparency about the methods to facilitate widespread application and reproducibility of EEG microstate analysis by introducing a new EEGlab toolbox for Matlab. EEGlab and the Microstate toolbox are open source, allowing the user to keep track of all details in every analysis step. The toolbox is speciﬁcally designed to facilitate the development of new methods. While the toolbox can be controlled with a graphical user interface (GUI), making it easier for newcomers to take their ﬁrst steps in exploring the possibilities of microstate analysis, the Matlab framework allows advanced users to create scripts to automatise analysis for multiple subjects to avoid tediously repeating steps for every subject. This manuscript provides an overview of the most commonly applied microstate methods as well as a tutorial consisting of a comprehensive walk-through of the analysis of a small, publicly available dataset.},

	abstract = {A brain microstate is defined as a functional/physiological state of the brain during which specific neural computations are performed. It is characterized uniquelyby a fixed spatial distribution of active neuronal generators with time varying intensity. Brain electrical activity is modeled as being composed of a time sequence of nonoverlapping microstates with variable duration. A precise mathematical formulation of the model for evoked potential recordings is presented, where the microstates are represented as normalized vectors constitutedby scalpelectric potentials due to the underlying generators. An algorithm is developed for estimating the microstates, based on a modiied version of the classical IC-means clustering method, in which cluster orientations are estimated. Consequently, each instantaneous multichannel evoked potential measurement is classified as belonging to some microstate, thus producing a natural segmentation of brain activity. Use is made of statistical image segmentation techniques for obtaining smooth continuous segments. Time varying intensities are estimated by projecting the measurements onto their corresponding microstates. A goodness of fit statistic for the model is presented. Finally, a method is introduced for estimating the number of microstates, based on nonparametric data-driven statistical resampling techniques.},

abstract = {The present review discusses a well-established method for characterizing resting-state activity of the human brain using multichannel electroencephalography (EEG).
            This method involves the examination of electrical microstates in the brain, which are defined as successive short time periods during which the configuration of the scalp potential field remains semi-stable,
			suggesting quasi-simultaneity of activity among the nodes of large-scale networks. A few prototypic microstates, which occur in a repetitive sequence across time, can be reliably identified across participants.
			Researchers have proposed that these microstates represent the basic building blocks of the chain of spontaneous conscious mental processes, and that their occurrence and temporal dynamics determine the quality of mentation.
			Several studies have further demonstrated that disturbances of mental processes associated with neurological and psychiatric conditions manifest as changes in the temporal dynamics of specific microstates. Combined EEG-fMRI
			studies and EEG source imaging studies have indicated that EEG microstates are closely associated with resting-state networks as identified using fMRI. The scale-free properties of the time series of EEG microstates explain
			why similar networks can be observed at such different time scales. The present review will provide an overview of these EEG microstates, available methods for analysis, the functional interpretations of findings regarding
			these microstates, and their behavioral and clinical correlates.}
