# Summary

Pycrostates is a free and open source project for electroencephalography (EEG) microstates analysis. Microstates analysis is a method allowing investigation of spatiotemporal characteristics of EEG recordings. It consists in breaking down the multichannel EEG signal into a succession of quasi-stable state, each state being characterized by a spatial distribution of its scalp potentials also called microstate map or microstate topography. Pycrostates implements core functions such as preprocessing tools (global field power peaks extraction, resampling), clustering algorithm (modified version of the kmeans algorithm), clustering quality evaluations tools (silhouette, Dunn) and backfitting (also called prediction) needed to perform such analysis. It provides researchers all the block needed to design their own microstate analysis. Pycrostates is built to fit as best as it can in the python scientific environment and more particularly scikit-learn [@pedregosa_scikit-learn_nodate] and MNE-python [@gramfort_meg_2013]  from which it is inspired in its philosophy and its implementation [@buitinck_api_2013]. The library comes with extensive documentation including descriptions of all its algorithms and functions as well as several tutorials to help researcher to get started. Finally, pycrostates is provided under the new BSD license allowing code reuse, even in commercial products.
