# Summary

Microstate analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG), introduced in 1972 by
Lehman [@lehmann1971multichannel], is a spatiotemporal analysis technique that
takes advantage of the full spatial resolution of EEG recordings. Formalized
further by Pascual Marqui and colleagues [@pascual-marqui_segmentation_1995],
microstate analysis studies the distribution of the surface EEG potential maps
over time. It transforms the EEG recordings into sequences of successive states
of variable duration, called EEG microstates.

Pycrostates implements multiple modules that allow researchers to apply
microstate analysis on their datasets:

- the cluster module supports the different clustering algorithms that find the
  optimal topographic maps that sparsely represent the EEG.
- the segmentation module supports the study of microstates sequences and their
  summary measures.
- the metrics module quantifies the quality of the fitted clustering
  algorithms.

Additional modules help researchers to develop analysis pipelines:

- the dataset module provides direct access to preprocessed data that can be
  used to test pipelines. As of writing, it supports the LEMON dataset
  [@babayan_mind-brain-body_2019] comprising preprocessed EEG recordings of 227
  healthy participants.
- the viz module provides visualization tools for performing microstate
  analyses.

By design, Pycrostates is not restricted to EEG data. Its API is build on top
of the robust MNE-Python [@gramfort_meg_2013] ecosystem enabling a seamless
integration of microstates analysis. It's modular design supports all data
types from MNE-Python and future improvements and additions such as different
clustering algorithms or new tools for sequences analysis such as Markov
chains.

# Statement of need

Currently, several software and libraries are available to perform EEG
microstates analysis: Cartool [@brunet_spatiotemporal_nodate], Thomas Koening's
MATLAB microstates EEGLab toolbox (https://www.thomaskoenig.ch/index.php/software/microstates-in-eeglab),
or Andreas Trier Poulsen's MATLAB microstates EEGLab toolbox
[@poulsen_microstate_2018]. In the last few years, the Python programming
language ecosystem has expanded considerably, especially in scientific fields.
MNE-Python [@gramfort_meg_2013] stands out for the analysis of
human neurophysiological data. Current Python implementations of microstate
analysis include the Python 2 library from Frederic von Wegner
[@von_wegner_information-theoretical_2018], Neurokit [@Makowski2021neurokit],
Keypy [@patricia_milz_2016_48830] (no longer maintained) and the
MNE-microstates package from Marijn van Vliet.

However, the current implementations of microstates analysis have a limited
number of features and/or are not maintained on a regular basis. Most of them
perform the microstate segmentation at the subject level while computation of
microstates topographies and segmentations at the group level are not covered.
Pycrostates is based on the robust MNE-Python ecosystem and complements it with
simple tools for developing integrated microstates analysis pipelines. It
offers flexible classes, enabling group level analysis and advanced
segmentation features such as smoothing and small segment rejection which are
especially useful for handling low signal to noise datapoints occurring during
microstate polarity inversions.

Pycrostates API supports most of the analyses proposed in the literature
[@MICHEL2018577] and in standard but non-Python packages such as
Cartool [@brunet_spatiotemporal_nodate] or MATLAB microstates EEGLab toolboxes.
Pycrostates is built with a modular and scalable design, following modern
development methods and standards to facilitate its maintenance and evolution
over time. It offers a solid basis to the open source community to use
microstate methodology and to make it evolve. Finally, new users will benefit
from the exhaustive documentation and tutorials describing microstate analysis.

With this contribution, the developer team is excited to provide the
state-of-the-art in microstates analysis and is looking forward to welcoming
new contributors and users from the broader MNE, neuroscience, and
electrophysiology communities.
