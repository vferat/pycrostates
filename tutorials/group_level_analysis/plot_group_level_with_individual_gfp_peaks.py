"""
Group level analysis from individual gfp peaks
====================

In this tutorial, we will learn how to conduct group level analysis
by computing group level topographies based on individual gfp peaks.

#%%
# .. note::
#
#     The lemon datasets is composed of EEGLAB files. To use the MNE reader
#     :func:`mne.io.read_raw_eeglab`, the ``pymatreader`` optional dependency
#     is required. Use the following installation method appropriate for your
#     environment:
#
#     - ``pip install pymatreader``
#     - ``conda install -c conda-forge pymatreader``
#
#     Note that an environment created via the MNE installers includes
#     ``pymatreader`` by default.
