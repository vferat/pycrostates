Resampling

This example demonstrates how to resample a recording.

#%%
# .. note::
#
#     The lemon datasets is composed of EEGLAB files. To use the MNE reader
#     :func:`mne.io.read_raw_eeglab`, the ``pymatreader`` optional dependency
#     is required. Use the following installation method appropriate for your
#     environment:
#
#     - ``pip install pymatreader``
#     - ``conda install -c conda-forge pymatreader``
#
#     Note that an environment created via the MNE installers includes
#     ``pymatreader`` by default.

import mne
from mne.io import read_raw_eeglab

from pycrostates.datasets import lemon


raw_fname = lemon.data_path(subject_id='010004', condition='EC')
raw = read_raw_eeglab(raw_fname, preload=True)
raw.crop(0, 30)

raw.pick('eeg')
raw.set_eeg_reference('average')

#%%
# We can now use the :func:`~pycrostates.preprocessing.resample` function to
# draw n_resamples of n_samples for our recording where n_sample defines the
# number of sample contained in each epoch and n_resamples defines the number of
# epochs to draw.

from pycrostates.preprocessing import resample
resamples = resample(raw, n_resamples=10, n_samples=150, random_state=40)
resamples

#%%
# We can also use the 'coverage' parameter to automatically compute one of the
# two previous parameters based on the amount of original data we want to
# cover. For example by setting n_resamples and coverage:

resamples = resample(raw, n_resamples=10, coverage=0.5, random_state=40)
resamples
#%% or by setting n_samples and coverage:

resamples = resample(raw, n_samples=150, coverage=0.5, random_state=40)
resamples
#%%
# Finally, we can also use this function to resample :func:`~mne.epochs.Epochs`

epochs = mne.make_fixed_length_epochs(raw, duration=2, preload=True)
resamples = resample(epochs, n_samples=150, coverage=0.5, random_state=40)
