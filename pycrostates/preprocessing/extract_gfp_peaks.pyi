    """:term:`Global Field Power` (:term:`GFP`) peaks extraction.

    Extract :term:`Global Field Power` (:term:`GFP`) peaks from :class:`~mne.Epochs` or
    :class:`~mne.io.Raw`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    inst : Raw | Epochs
        Instance from which to extract :term:`global field power` (GFP) peaks.
    picks : str | list | slice | None
        Channels to use for GFP computation. Note that all channels selected must have
        the same type. Slices and lists of integers will be interpreted as channel
        indices. In lists, channel name strings (e.g. ``['Fp1', 'Fp2']``) will pick the
        given channels. Can also be the string values ``“all”`` to pick all channels, or
        ``“data”`` to pick data channels. ``"eeg"`` (default) will pick all eeg
        channels. Note that channels in ``info['bads']`` will be included if their
        names or indices are explicitly provided.
    return_all : bool
        If True, the returned `~pycrostates.io.ChData` instance will include all
        channels. If False (default), the returned `~pycrostates.io.ChData` instance
        will only include channels used for GFP computation (i.e ``picks``).
    min_peak_distance : int
        Required minimal horizontal distance (``≥ 1`) in samples between neighboring
        peaks. Smaller peaks are removed first until the condition is fulfilled for all
        remaining peaks. Default to ``1``.
    tmin : float
        Start time of the raw data to use in seconds (must be >= 0).
    tmax : float
        End time of the raw data to use in seconds (cannot exceed data duration).
    reject_by_annotation : bool
        Whether to omit bad segments from the data before fitting. If ``True``
        (default), annotated segments whose description begins with ``'bad'`` are
        omitted. If ``False``, no rejection based on annotations is performed.

        Has no effect if ``inst`` is not a :class:`mne.io.Raw` object.
    verbose : int | str | bool | None
        Sets the verbosity level. The verbosity increases gradually between ``"CRITICAL"``,
        ``"ERROR"``, ``"WARNING"``, ``"INFO"`` and ``"DEBUG"``. If None is provided, the
        verbosity is set to ``"WARNING"``. If a bool is provided, the verbosity is set to
        ``"WARNING"`` for False and to ``"INFO"`` for True.

    Returns
    -------
    ch_data : ChData
        Samples at global field power peaks.

    Notes
    -----
    The :term:`Global Field Power` (:term:`GFP`) peaks are extracted with
    :func:`scipy.signal.find_peaks`. Only the ``distance`` argument is filled with the
    value provided in ``min_peak_distance``. The other arguments are set to their
    default values.

    Parameters
    ----------

    min_peak_distance : int
        Required minimal horizontal distance (>= 1) in samples between neighboring
