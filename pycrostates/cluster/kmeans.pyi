class ModKMeans(_BaseCluster):
    """Modified K-Means clustering algorithm.

    See :footcite:t:`Marqui1995` for additional information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_clusters : int
        The number of clusters, i.e. the number of microstates.
    n_init : int
        Number of time the k-means algorithm is run with different centroid seeds. The
        final result will be the run with the highest Global Explained Variance (GEV).
    max_iter : int
        Maximum number of iterations of the K-means algorithm for a single run.
    tol : float
        Relative tolerance with regards estimate residual noise in the cluster centers
        of two consecutive iterations to declare convergence.
    random_state : None | int | instance of ~numpy.random.RandomState
        A seed for the NumPy random number generator (RNG). If ``None`` (default),
        the seed will be  obtained from the operating system
        (see  :class:`~numpy.random.RandomState` for details), meaning it will most
        likely produce different output every time this function or method is run.
        To achieve reproducible results, pass a value here to explicitly initialize
        the RNG with a defined state.

        Parameters
        ----------
        inst : Raw | Epochs | ChData
            MNE `~mne.io.Raw`, `~mne.Epochs` or `~pycrostates.io.ChData` object from
            which to extract :term:`cluster centers`.
        picks : str | list | slice | None
            Channels to include. Note that all channels selected must have the same
            type. Slices and lists of integers will be interpreted as channel indices.
            In lists, channel name strings (e.g. ``['Fp1', 'Fp2']``) will pick the given
            channels. Can also be the string values ``“all”`` to pick all channels, or
            ``“data”`` to pick data channels. ``"eeg"`` (default) will pick all eeg
            channels. Note that channels in ``info['bads']`` will be included if their
            names or indices are explicitly provided.
        tmin : float
            Start time of the raw data to use in seconds (must be >= 0).
        tmax : float | None
            End time of the raw data to use in seconds (cannot exceed data duration).
            If ``None`` (default), the current end of the data is used.
        reject_by_annotation : bool
            Whether to omit bad segments from the data before fitting. If ``True``
            (default), annotated segments whose description begins with ``'bad'`` are
            omitted. If ``False``, no rejection based on annotations is performed.

            Has no effect if ``inst`` is not a :class:`mne.io.Raw` object.
        n_jobs : int | None
            The number of jobs to run in parallel. If ``-1``, it is set
            to the number of CPU cores. Requires the :mod:`joblib` package.
            ``None`` (default) is a marker for 'unset' that will be interpreted
            as ``n_jobs=1`` (sequential execution) unless the call is performed under
            a :class:`joblib:joblib.parallel_config` context manager that sets another
            value for ``n_jobs``.
        verbose : int | str | bool | None
            Sets the verbosity level. The verbosity increases gradually between ``"CRITICAL"``,
            ``"ERROR"``, ``"WARNING"``, ``"INFO"`` and ``"DEBUG"``. If None is provided, the
            verbosity is set to ``"WARNING"``. If a bool is provided, the verbosity is set to
            ``"WARNING"`` for False and to ``"INFO"`` for True.
