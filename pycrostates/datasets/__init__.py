"""This module contains functions to fetch remote datasets. All the dataset
fetchers are available in :mod:`pycrostates.datasets`. To download any of the
datasets, use the ``data_path`` function associated to this dataset.

All fetchers will check the default download location first to see if the
dataset is already on your computer, and only download it if necessary."""
