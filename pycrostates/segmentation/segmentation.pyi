    raw : Raw
        `~mne.io.Raw` instance used for prediction.

        Parameters
        ----------
        tmin : float
            Start time of the raw data to use in seconds (must be >= 0).
        tmax : float
            End time of the raw data to use in seconds (cannot exceed data duration).
        cmap : str | colormap | None
            The colormap to use. If None, ``viridis`` is used.
        axes : Axes | None
            Either ``None`` to create a new figure or axes on which the segmentation is
            plotted.
        cbar_axes : Axes | None
            Axes on which to draw the colorbar, otherwise the colormap takes space from the main
            axes.
        block : bool
            Whether to halt program execution until the figure is closed.
        verbose : int | str | bool | None
            Sets the verbosity level. The verbosity increases gradually between ``"CRITICAL"``,
            ``"ERROR"``, ``"WARNING"``, ``"INFO"`` and ``"DEBUG"``. If None is provided, the
