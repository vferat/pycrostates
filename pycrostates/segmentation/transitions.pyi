    """Compute the observed transition matrix.

    Count the number of transitions from one state to another and aggregate the result
    as statistic. Transitions "from" and "to" unlabeled segments ``-1`` are ignored.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels : array of shape ``(n_samples,)`` or ``(n_epochs, n_samples)``
        Microstates labels attributed to each sample, i.e. the segmentation.
    n_clusters : int
        The number of clusters, i.e. the number of microstates.
    stat : str
        Aggregate statistic to compute transitions. Can be:

        * ``count``: show the number of observations of each transition.
        * ``probability`` or ``proportion``: normalize count such as the probabilities along
          the first axis is always equal to ``1``.
        * ``percent``: normalize count such as the probabilities along the first axis is
          always equal to ``100``.
    ignore_repetitions : bool
        If ``True``, ignores state repetitions.
        For example, the input sequence ``AAABBCCD``
        will be transformed into ``ABCD`` before any calculation.
        This is equivalent to setting the duration of all states to 1 sample.

    Returns
    -------
    T : array of shape ``(n_cluster, n_cluster)``
        Array of transition probability values from one label to another.
        First axis indicates state ``"from"``. Second axis indicates state ``"to"``.

    Compute the theoretical transition matrix as if time course was ignored, but
