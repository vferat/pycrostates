            When working with `~mne.Epochs`, this method will put together segments of
            all epochs. This could lead to wrong interpretation especially on state
            durations. To avoid this behaviour, make sure to set the ``reject_edges``
            parameter to ``True`` when creating the segmentation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        norm_gfp : bool
            If True, the :term:`global field power` (GFP) is normalized.
        return_dist : bool
            If True, return the parameters distributions.

        Returns
        -------
        dict : dict
            Dictionaries containing microstate parameters as key/value pairs.
            Keys are named as follow: ``'{microstate name}_{parameter name}'``.

            Available parameters are listed below:

            * ``mean_corr``: Mean correlation value for each time point assigned to a
              given state.
            * ``gev``: Global explained variance expressed by a given state.
              It is the sum of global explained variance values of each time point
              assigned to a given state.
            * ``timecov``: Time coverage, the proportion of time during which
              a given state is active. This metric is expressed as a ratio.
            * ``meandurs``: Mean durations of segments assigned to a given
              state. This metric is expressed in seconds (s).
            * ``occurrences``: Occurrences per second, the mean number of
              segment assigned to a given state per second. This metrics is expressed
              in segment per second.
            * ``dist_corr`` (req. ``return_dist=True``): Distribution of
              correlations values of each time point assigned to a given state.
            * ``dist_gev`` (req. ``return_dist=True``): Distribution of global
              explained variances values of each time point assigned to a given state.
            * ``dist_durs`` (req. ``return_dist=True``): Distribution of
              durations of each segments assigned to a given state. Each value is
              expressed in seconds (s).

        --------
        When working with `~mne.Epochs`, this method will take into account transitions

        Transition "from" and "to" unlabeled segments ``-1`` are ignored.

        Parameters
        ----------
        stat : str
            Aggregate statistic to compute transitions. Can be:

            * ``probability`` or ``proportion``: normalize count such as the probabilities along
              the first axis is always equal to ``1``.
            * ``percent``: normalize count such as the probabilities along the first axis is
              always equal to ``100``.
        ignore_repetitions : bool
            If ``True``, ignores state repetitions.
            For example, the input sequence ``AAABBCCD``
            will be transformed into ``ABCD`` before any calculation.
            This is equivalent to setting the duration of all states to 1 sample.

        Returns
        -------
        T : array of shape ``(n_cluster, n_cluster)``
            Array of transition probability values from one label to another.
            First axis indicates state ``"from"``. Second axis indicates state ``"to"``.
