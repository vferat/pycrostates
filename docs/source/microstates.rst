What is EEG microstates ?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Microstates analysis is a method allowing investigation of spatiotemporal
characteristics of EEG recordings. It consists in breaking down the
multichannel EEG signal into a succession of quasi-stable state, each state
being characterized by a spatial distribution of its scalp potentials also
called microstate map or microstate topography.

How to compute EEG microstates ?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This decomposition is based on two consecutive steps: the clustering which
allows to define topographies that best represent the studied data and the
backfitting than consist on assigning each timepoint of one or several EEG
recordings to the previously extracted topographies.

The methods relies on assigning timepoints to the most similar microstate map,
that is why it is important to define how distance between two topographies is
computed. For microstate analysis, it is the inverse of the absolute value of
the spatial correlation that is used as a measure of distance to carry out all
computations. The absolute value is used in order to ignore topography
polarities of the topographies, as state can oscillate in a given configuration
(i.e topography).

Pycrostates implements a conveniente class
:class:`pycrostates.cluster.ModKMeans` allowing to perform clustering through
the :meth:`pycrostates.cluster.ModKMeans.fit` method and backfitting through
the :meth:`pycrostates.cluster.ModKMeans.predict` method. It also implements
other methods to facilitate the analysis and display of results.
