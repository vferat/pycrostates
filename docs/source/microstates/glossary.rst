    GFP
        Global Field Power. For EEG data, it is computed as the standard
        deviation of the sensors at a given timepoint. Local maxima of the
        global field power (GFP) are known to represent the portions of EEG
        data with highest signal-to-noise ratio (:cite:t:`KOENIG20161104`).

    GEV
        Global explained variance.
        Total explained variance expressed by a given state.
        It is computed as the sum of the explained variance
        multiplied by the :term:`GFP` of each sample
        assigned to a given state.

    cluster centers
        Arithmetic mean of all the points belonging to the cluster. In the
        context of microstate analysis, it corresponds to the microstates
        topographies.

    inter-cluster distance
        Distance between two datapoints belonging to two different clusters.
        Depending on the metric used, it can be computed in different ways, for
        example (but no limited to) as the average distance between all
        datapoint belonging to different clusters, the distance between two
        :term:`cluster centers`, the minimal distance between two datapoints
        belonging to different cluster.

    intra-cluster distance
        Distance between two datapoint belonging to the same cluster. Depending
        on the metric used, it can be computed in different ways, for example
        (but no limited to) as the average distance between all datapoint
        belonging to the same cluster, the average distance between all
        datapoint at the cluster center or the maximal distance between two
        datapoints belonging to the same cluster.
